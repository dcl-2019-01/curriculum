    This article lays out more of the details behind tidy data, and works
    through a few more case studies. However, it uses a previous iteration
    of the tools, using reshape2 instead of tidyr. To see the code translated
    into tidyr, read the
    [tidy data vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html).
