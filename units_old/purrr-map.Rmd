## Introduction

One of the biggest advantage to using a programming langauge rather than a point-and-click GUI is that you can automate repetitive tasks. In this lesson, you'll the learn basics of the purrr package in order to repeat a task across multiple elements of a vector.  We'll also use the repurrrsive package, which contains some interesting data sets.

```{r setup}
library(purrr)
library(repurrrsive)
```

This lesson was adapted from "[An introduction to purrr](https://github.com/cwickham/purrr-tutorial)" by Charlotte Wickham.

## Star Wars

To illustrate purrr we're going to use `repurrrsive::starwars`, which contains data about characters in the Star Wars movies. The data is contained in a data structure that we haven't talk about yet: a list. Lists are a step up in complexity from atomic vectors, because lists can contain other lists. This makes them suitable for representing hierarchical or tree-like structures. 

```{r}
typeof(sw_people)
length(sw_people)
```

The best to interactively explore a complex list is with `View()` in RStudio. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/view-sw_people.png")
```

Failing that, it's often possible to extract out the first element with `x[[1]]`, then use `str()` on that:

```{r}
luke <- sw_people[[1]]
str(luke)
```

In this case, each element of the `sw_people` list is another list containing data about a character.

### `map()` basics

There are lots of questions that are easy to answer if we have one character, but harder if we have many characters. For example, image we want to find out how many starships Luke has been on:

```{r}
luke[["starships"]]
length(luke[["starships"]])
```

It's easy to do this for a few individuals:

```{r}
leia <- sw_people[[5]]
length(leia[["starships"]])
```

But what if you want to do it for all 87 people? Using copy and paste will be both tedious and error prone.

```{r}
length(sw_people[[1]][["starships"]])
length(sw_people[[2]][["starships"]])
length(sw_people[[3]][["starships"]])
# ...
length(sw_people[[87]][["starships"]])
```

Instead, we're going to learn a new approach using `purrr::map()`. `map()` has two key arguments: 

* `.x`: an atomic vector, list, or data frame to do manipulate.
* `.f`: the thing to do each element.

There are many ways to specify `.f` which you'll learn about later. For now, we're going to focus on using it with __formulas__, which are created with `~`. Formulas allow us to extract out a common pattern, or recipe, from repeated code. 

Creating a recipe is easy: take a single solution and put a `~` in front of it, and replace the part the varies over elements with `.x`, a pronoun. For example, to find the number of starships for a person, we'd do:

```{r}
~ length(.x$starships)
```

This is a formula. A formula doesn't do anything; it just captures your intent. Here `.x` is a pronoun like "it", `map()` will replace `.x` with each element of the list in turn. To use formula, we need to apply it to the `sw_people` list with `map()`:

```{r}
ships <- map(sw_people, ~ length(.x$starships))
head(ships)
```

Note that the output is quite long so I save it to a variable and then only look at the first few entries (using the helpful `head()` function).

This is much easier than copy and pasting!

## Output type

`map()` always returns a list. This is the most general function because any R data structure can be stored inside a list. But often you want something simpler, so you'll use one of the map variants:

* `map_lgl()` makes a logical vector.
* `map_int()` makes an integer vector.
* `map_dbl()` makes a double vector.
* `map_chr()` makes a character vector.

Here are a few examples: try and figure out what they do. If you don't understand, translate back from the generic formula to a specific example. For example, you could translate `~ .x[["name"]]` back to `luke[["name"]]`.

```{r}
map_chr(sw_people, ~ .x[["name"]])
map_lgl(sw_people, ~ .x[["gender"]] == "male")
map_int(sw_people, ~ length(.x$starships))
map_chr(sw_people, ~ .x[["hair_color"]])
```

The `map_` functions always either give you the type of vector that you asked for, or they throw an error. Sometimes this reveals surprising information about your data:

```{r, error = TRUE}
map_dbl(sw_people, ~ .x[["mass"]])
```

Why not? Whenever you get an error, a good strategy is to go back to the basics and look at a single value:

```{r}
luke[["mass"]]
```

`mass` has been recorded as a string! So lets use `map_chr()` to get it.

```{r}
map_chr(sw_people, ~ .x[["mass"]])
```

We probably want that as a number so we can use `read::parse_number()`, and tell it that in this variable missing values are recorded as "unknown":

```{r}
sw_people %>% 
  map_chr(~ .x[["mass"]]) %>% 
  readr::parse_number(na = "unknown")
```

## Shortcuts

So far we've used a formula recipe for the second argument of `map()`. But it can be lots of other things. For example, it can also be a string or integer:

* `map(.x, .f = "some_name")` is equivalent to `map(.x, ~ .x[["some_name"]])`
* `map(.x, .f = some_name)` is equivalent to `map(.x, ~ .x[[some_name]])`

That lets us simplify some exressions:

```{r}
# BEFORE: 
# map_chr(sw_people, ~ .x[["mass"]])

# AFTER
map_chr(sw_people, "mass")
```

`.f` can also be a function: `map(.x, .f = some_function, ...)` is equivalent to `map(.x, .f = ~ some_function(.x, ...))`

```{r}
# BEFORE
# map_int(sw_people, ~ length(.x$starships))

sw_people %>%
  map("starships") %>%
  map_int(length)
```

Generally, I think the "after" form is a little better. It's usually easier to solve a problem by taking one small step at a time. Check your results, then only proceed to the next step if they're proceed. Each step becomes one entry in a pipeline. This might lead to a long pipeline; if you're worried about that, you can rewrite it for clarity and concision __after__ you have got it working.
