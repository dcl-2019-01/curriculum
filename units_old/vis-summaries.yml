title: Grouped summaries

  Summary functions take a vector of data and return a single number; you
  use them in conjunction with `dplyr::summarise()`. The ggplot2 equivalent
  are the summary geoms, which split the data into pieces, apply some summary
  and visualise the results.

  Summaries are useful when you have a lot of data (and plotting it all leads
  to overplotting), or when the data is noisy (and you need to make small
  but consistent patterns more clear).

    do some aggregation before visualising the data.
