title: Exporting data
theme: wrangle

desc: |
  There are three main reasons you might want to export a tibble from R:

  * To share with others.

  * To track changes over time using Git & GitHub.

  * To cache partial results so you don't need to re-run a complete tidying
    work flow every time you restart your analysis.

  Generally, csv is a good way to store data: it's simple, and can be
  read by a large variety of tools (including GitHub which displays it nicely
  online). However, it doesn't store some important metadata, and it's not
  optimised for efficient reading. For those scenarios, you may want to use
  RDS or feather files instead.
