  operate on data frames. You use them with vector and summary functions which work
  with individual variables (or vectors).\n\nVector functions\n----------------\n\nA
  vector function takes one (or sometimes more) vectors as input and returns a vector
  of the same length as output. These are typically used with `mutate()` to create
  new variables.\n\nI can't list every vector function, but here's a few that are
  often useful:\n\n-   Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`. These are all
  vectorised, using the so called \"recycling rules\". If one parameter is shorter
  than the other, it will be automatically extended to be the same length. This is
  most useful when one of the arguments is a single number: `air_time / 60`, `hours
  * 60 + minute`, etc.\n\n    Arithmetic operators are also useful in conjunction
  with the aggregate functions you'll learn about later. For example, `x / sum(x)`
  calculates the proportion of a total, and `y - mean(y)` computes the difference
  from the mean.\n\n-   Modular arithmetic: `%/%` (integer division) and `%%` (remainder),
  where `x == y * (x %/% y) + (x %% y)`. Modular arithmetic is a handy tool because
  it allows you to break integers up into pieces. For example, in the flights dataset,
  you can compute `hour` and `minute` from `dep_time` with:\n\n    ``` r\n    flights
  %>% \n      transmute(\n        dep_time,\n        hour = dep_time %/% 100,\n        minute
  = dep_time %% 100\n      )\n    #> # A tibble: 336,776 x 3\n    #>    dep_time  hour
  minute\n    #>       <int> <dbl>  <dbl>\n    #>  1      517  5.00   17.0\n    #>
  \ 2      533  5.00   33.0\n    #>  3      542  5.00   42.0\n    #>  4      544  5.00
  \  44.0\n    #>  5      554  5.00   54.0\n    #>  6      554  5.00   54.0\n    #>
  \ 7      555  5.00   55.0\n    #>  8      557  5.00   57.0\n    #>  9      557  5.00
  \  57.0\n    #> 10      558  5.00   58.0\n    #> # ... with 336,766 more rows\n
  \   ```\n\n-   Logs: `log()`, `log2()`, `log10()`. Logarithms are an incredibly
  useful transformation for dealing with data that ranges across multiple orders of
  magnitude. They also convert multiplicative relationships to additive, a feature
  we'll come back to in modelling.\n\n    All else being equal, I recommend using
  `log2()` because it's easy to interpret: a difference of 1 on the log scale corresponds
  to doubling on the original scale and a difference of -1 corresponds to halving.\n\n-
  \  Logical comparisons, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `!=`, which you learned about earlier.
  If you're doing a complex sequence of logical operations it's often a good idea
  to store the interim values in new variables so you can check that each step is
  working as expected.\n\n-   `if_else()` allows you perform a conditional calculation.
  The first argument should be a logical statement; the second argument is the value
  to use if the first argument is true; the third argument is the value to use if
  the first argument is false.\n\n    ``` r\n    flights %>% \n      transmute(\n
  \       on_time = if_else(arr_delay < 0, \"early\", \"late\")\n      )\n    #> #
  A tibble: 336,776 x 1\n    #>    on_time\n    #>    <chr>  \n    #>  1 late   \n
  \   #>  2 late   \n    #>  3 late   \n    #>  4 early  \n    #>  5 early  \n    #>
  \ 6 late   \n    #>  7 late   \n    #>  8 early  \n    #>  9 early  \n    #> 10
  late   \n    #> # ... with 336,766 more rows\n    ```\n\n-   `case_when()` allows
  you to combine multiple logical conditions, evaluated in turn. Each condition goes
  on the left hand side of the `~`, and the result goes on the right hand side.\n\n
  \   ``` r\n    flights %>% \n      transmute(\n        on_time = case_when(\n          abs(arr_delay)
  < 10 ~ \"on time\",\n          arr_delay < 0 ~ \"early\",\n          arr_delay >
  0 ~ \"late\",\n          is.na(arr_delay) ~ \"cancelled\"\n        )\n      )\n
  \   #> # A tibble: 336,776 x 1\n    #>    on_time\n    #>    <chr>  \n    #>  1
  late   \n    #>  2 late   \n    #>  3 late   \n    #>  4 early  \n    #>  5 early
  \ \n    #>  6 late   \n    #>  7 late   \n    #>  8 early  \n    #>  9 on time\n
  \   #> 10 on time\n    #> # ... with 336,766 more rows\n    ```\n\nSummary functions\n-----------------\n\nA
  summary function takes a vector of inputs and returns a single output. They are
  most commonly used with `summarise()`.\n\nJust using means, counts, and sum can
  get you a long way, but R provides many other useful summary functions:\n\n-   Measures
  of location: we've used `mean(x)`, but `median(x)` is also useful. The mean is the
  sum divided by the length; the median is a value where 50% of `x` is above it, and
  50% is below it.\n\n    It's sometimes useful to combine aggregation with logical
  subsetting. We haven't talked about this sort of subsetting yet, but you'll learn
  more about it later.\n\n    ``` r\n    flights %>% \n      group_by(year, month,
  day) %>% \n      summarise(\n        avg_delay1 = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),\n
  \       # the average positive delay\n        avg_delay2 = mean(arr_delay[arr_delay
  > 0], na.rm = TRUE)\n      ) %>% \n      ungroup()\n    #> # A tibble: 365 x 5\n
  \   #>     year month   day avg_delay1 avg_delay2\n    #>    <int> <int> <int>      <dbl>
  \     <dbl>\n    #>  1  2013     1     1     12.7         32.5\n    #>  2  2013
  \    1     2     12.7         32.0\n    #>  3  2013     1     3      5.73        27.7\n
  \   #>  4  2013     1     4    - 1.93        28.3\n    #>  5  2013     1     5    -
  1.53        22.6\n    #>  6  2013     1     6      4.24        24.4\n    #>  7  2013
  \    1     7    - 4.95        27.8\n    #>  8  2013     1     8    - 3.23        20.8\n
  \   #>  9  2013     1     9    - 0.264       25.6\n    #> 10  2013     1    10    -
  5.90        27.3\n    #> # ... with 355 more rows\n    ```\n\n-   Measures of spread:
  `sd(x)`, `IQR(x)`, `mad(x)`. The mean squared deviation, or standard deviation or
  sd for short, is the standard measure of spread. The interquartile range `IQR()`
  and median absolute deviation `mad(x)` are robust equivalents that may be more useful
  if you have outliers.\n\n    ``` r\n    # Why is distance to some destinations more
  variable than to others?\n    flights %>% \n      group_by(dest) %>% \n      summarise(distance_sd
  = sd(distance, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% \n      arrange(desc(distance_sd))\n    #> # A
  tibble: 105 x 2\n    #>    dest  distance_sd\n    #>    <chr>       <dbl>\n    #>
  \ 1 EGE         10.5 \n    #>  2 SAN         10.3 \n    #>  3 SFO         10.2 \n
  \   #>  4 HNL         10.0 \n    #>  5 SEA          9.98\n    #>  6 LAS          9.91\n
  \   #>  7 PDX          9.88\n    #>  8 PHX          9.86\n    #>  9 LAX          9.66\n
  \   #> 10 IND          9.46\n    #> # ... with 95 more rows\n    ```\n\n-   Measures
  of rank: `min(x)`, `quantile(x, 0.25)`, `max(x)`. Quantiles are a generalisation
  of the median. For example, `quantile(x, 0.25)` will find a value of `x` that is
  greater than 25% of the values, and less than the remaining 75%.\n\n    ``` r\n
  \   # When do the first and last flights leave each day?\n    flights %>% \n      group_by(year,
  month, day) %>% \n      summarise(\n        first = min(sched_dep_time, na.rm =
  TRUE),\n        last = max(sched_dep_time, na.rm = TRUE)\n      ) %>% \n      ungroup()\n
  \   #> # A tibble: 365 x 5\n    #>     year month   day first  last\n    #>    <int>
  <int> <int> <dbl> <dbl>\n    #>  1  2013     1     1   515  2359\n    #>  2  2013
  \    1     2   500  2359\n    #>  3  2013     1     3   500  2359\n    #>  4  2013
  \    1     4   500  2359\n    #>  5  2013     1     5   500  2359\n    #>  6  2013
  \    1     6   500  2359\n    #>  7  2013     1     7   500  2359\n    #>  8  2013
  \    1     8   500  2359\n    #>  9  2013     1     9   500  2359\n    #> 10  2013
  \    1    10   500  2359\n    #> # ... with 355 more rows\n    ```\n\n-   Measures
  of position: `first(x)`, `nth(x, 2)`, `last(x)`. These work similarly to `x[1]`,
  `x[2]`, and `x[length(x)]` but let you set a default value if that position does
  not exist (i.e. you're trying to get the 3rd element from a group that only has
  two elements). For example, we can find the first and last departure for each day:\n\n
  \   ``` r\n    flights %>% \n      filter(!is.na(dep_time)) %>% \n      group_by(year,
  month, day) %>% \n      summarise(\n        first_dep = first(dep_time), \n        last_dep
  = last(dep_time)\n      ) %>% \n      ungroup()\n    #> # A tibble: 365 x 5\n    #>

  to filtering on ranks. Filtering gives you all variables, with each observation

  \  Counts: You've seen `n()`, which takes no arguments, and returns the size of
  the current group. To count the number of non-missing values, use `sum(!is.na(x))`.
  To count the number of distinct (unique) values, use `n_distinct(x)`.\n\n    ```

  %>% \n      summarise(carriers = n_distinct(carrier)) %>% \n      arrange(desc(carriers))\n

  of logical values: `sum(x > 10)`, `mean(y == 0)`. When used with numeric functions,
  `TRUE` is converted to 1 and `FALSE` to 0. This makes `sum()` and `mean()` very
  useful: `sum(x)` gives the number of `TRUE`s in `x`, and `mean(x)` gives the proportion.\n\n
