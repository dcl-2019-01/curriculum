  A __tidy__ data frame is a data frame (or tibble) where the variables in
  columns, and the cases (or observations) are in the rows. All the of the
  built-in datasets that you've worked with so far have been tidy, but
  you'll soon encounter new datasets that need to be tidied before you can
  work with them.
