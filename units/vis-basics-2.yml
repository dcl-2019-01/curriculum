  Now it's time to learn some more of the components that make up ggplot2.

  *  __Statistical transformations__, or stats for short, allow you to plot
     summaries of the data and are needed for important visualisations like
    the histogram.

  * __Position adjustments__ help handle overlapping objects. They're essential
    for bar graphs, but are also useful for point data.

  * __Coordinate systems__ control how the x and y aesthetics map to position
    on the plot. You'll use them least of any ggplot2 component, but when
    you do need them they're invaluable.

  * You'll also learn a bit about the underlying theory of ggplot2,
    the __layered grammar of graphics__.

  Finally, you'll learn a more compact style of ggplot2 calls that you'll
  use throughout the rest of the course.
