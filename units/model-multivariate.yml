title: Models with multiple variables
theme: model

desc: |
  Models with a single variable can be useful (if you want to remove a single
  strong trend), but almost every real model contains multiple variables. In
  this unit, you'll learn how to visualise these more complicated models,
  including models for categorical data (i.e. factors).
