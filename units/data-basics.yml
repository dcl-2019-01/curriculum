  Learn what a data frame looks like when printed, and identify its variables
  and their types. We're going to use the `mpg` and `flights` datasets
  frequently, so you'll start by familiarising yourself with them.

  NB: when we need to be specific about which package a dataset or function
  comes from, we write it like `package_name::function_name`. `mpg`
  and `flights` come from the ggplot2 and nycflights13 packages respectively,
  so when we want to be explicit we'll write `ggplot2::mpg` and
  `nycflights13::flights`.
