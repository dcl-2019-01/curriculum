  Code style is simultaneously incredibly important and utterly trivial.
  It'slikepunctuation: sureyoucanmakedowithoutit, but proper punctuation
  can sure make things easier to read!
  
  The specific style you follow is not as important as picking a consistent
  style and sticking to it. When you're working with others, it's a really
  good idea to share a common style so that everyone can easily read and
  write the code. These readings will introduce you to a common style.

  Install styler with `install.packages("styler")` and make sure you can
  locate the RStudio addin command for restyling selected code. This will
  make it very easy to apply the tidyverse style guide automatically.

    The official tidyverse style guide includes more information than the DCL 
    style guide. Take a look at chapters 1-4.
