  Code style is simultaneously incredibly important and utterly trivial.
  It'slikepunctuation: sureyoucanmakedowithoutit, but proper punctuation
  can sure make things easier to read!

  Install styler with `install.packages("styler")` and make sure you can
  locate the RStudio addin command for restyling selected code. This will
  make it very easy to apply the tidyverse style guide automatically.

    The specific style you follow is not as important as picking a consistent
    style and sticking to it. When you're working with others, it's a really
    good idea to share a common style so that everyone can easily read and
    write the code. In this class, we'll use the tidyverse style guide.
