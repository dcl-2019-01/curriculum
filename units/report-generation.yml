  So far you've turned `.Rmd` files into fully-fleshed reports using
  RStudio. It is also useful to know how to do so programmatically so that
  you can automate your R Markdown workflow. This is particularly useful
  in conjunction with parameterised reports and `purrr::pwalk()`.

  This technique isn't discussed frequently, but I think it's extremely
  powerful. It might stretch your brain a bit, and you might not understand
  exactly how it works, but it's useful pattern to know.

    Focus particularly on the "passing parameters" section as that shows
    how to call `rmarkdown::render()`, which is the code equivalent
    of the "knit" button in RStudio.

    The purrr function we're going to use is `pwalk()`. It isn't described
    in detail in R4DS but it's a combination of `pmap()` and `walk()`.
