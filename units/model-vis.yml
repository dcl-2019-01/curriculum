title: Fitting and visualizing models
theme: model

desc: |
  It is possible to understand some models (particularly popular statistical
  models) by learning how to interpret their coefficients. We're not going
  to take that approach here for two reasons:

  * It requires many months of study to interpret the coefficients of even
    fairly simple model classes like logistic regression or survival analysis.

  * Modern model classes (like random forests or SVMs) may have 100s or
    1000s (or more!) coefficients.

  Instead, we'll understand a model by looking at it's predictions. This
  doesn't cover every possible type of model (because not every model makes
  predictions) but it does cover a very wide class, including most models in
  statistics and machine learning.
