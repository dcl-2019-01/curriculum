desc: |
  You have the basics of parsing files, but now it's time to learn how
  to handle more complicated situations where readr doesn't automatically
  guess the correct columns types. In this unit you'll learn:

  * How to parse character vectors that are already in R, and how to
    tell readr how to parse vectors from disk.

  * How to recognise and fix problems caused by readr failing to guess
    the correct variable type.
