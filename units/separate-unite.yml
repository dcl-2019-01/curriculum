  `tidyr::separate()` is a useful tool for handling another common type of
  messiness: when multiple variables are crammed into a single column.
  Here you'll learn how to use `separate()` to pull them out into their own
  columns.

  The `sep` argument to `separate()` is a regular expression, which gives
  you a lot of power. You might also want to read about `extract()`:
  `str_split()` is to `separate()` as `str_match()` is to `extract().

  The inverse of `separate()` is `unite()`. You use it when you have a variable
  that is spread across multiple columns. This happens much less commonly.
