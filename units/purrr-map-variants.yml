title: Purrr map variants
theme: wrangle

desc: |
  `purrr::map()` and friends (like `purrr::map_chr()`) give you the ability
  to do something to each element of a vector. But what if you have multiple
  related vectors that you need to operate on? `map2()` and `pmap()` give
  you the ability to work with multiple vectors in parallel.
