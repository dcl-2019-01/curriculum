  Functions are powerful tool for reducing the amount of duplication in your
  code. Reducing duplication is a good principle because it means that
  each "fact" in your code is only stored in one place. When the requirements
  of your code change (as they invariably do), you only need to make the
  change in a single place, reducing the chances of inconsistencies within
  your code.
