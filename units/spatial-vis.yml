  of sample datasets.\n\n``` r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sf)\n\nnc <- read_sf(system.file(\"shape/nc.shp\",
  package = \"sf\"))\nstates <- st_as_sf(maps::map(\"state\", plot = FALSE, fill =
  TRUE))\n```\n\n`geom_sf()`\n-----------\n\nThe easiest way to get started is to
  supply an sf object to `geom_sf()`:\n\n``` r\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = nc)\n```\n\n![](spatial-vis_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)\n\nNotice
  that ggplot2 takes care of setting the aspect ratio correctly.\n\nYou can supply
  other aesthetics: for polygons, `fill` is most useful:\n\n``` r\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(aes(fill
  = AREA), data = nc, color = \"white\")\n```\n\n![](spatial-vis_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)\n\nWhen
  you include multiple layers, ggplot2 will take care of ensuring that they all have
  a common CRS so that it makes sense to overlay them.\n\n``` r\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data
  = states) + \n  geom_sf(data = nc)\n```\n\n![](spatial-vis_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)\n\nYou
  can combine `geom_sf()` with other geoms. In this case, `x` and `y` positions are
  assumed be in the same CRS as the sf object (typically these will be longitude and
  latitude).\n\n``` r\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = nc) +\n  annotate(\"point\", x
  = -80, y = 35, colour = \"red\", size = 4)\n```\n\n![](spatial-vis_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)\n\n`coord_sf()`\n------------\n\nYou'll
  need to use `coord_sf()` for two reasons:\n\n-   You want to zoom into a specified
  region of the plot by using `xlim` and `ylim`\n\n    ``` r\n    ggplot() +\n      geom_sf(data
  = nc) +\n      annotate(\"point\", x = -80, y = 35, colour = \"red\", size = 4)
  + \n      coord_sf(xlim = c(-81, -79), ylim = c(34, 36))\n    ```\n\n    ![](spatial-vis_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)\n\n-
  \  You want to override to use a specific projection. If you don't specify the `crs`
  argument, it just uses the one provided in the first layer. The following example
  uses \"USA\\_Contiguous\\_Albers\\_Equal\\_Area\\_Conic\". The easiest way to supply
  the CRS is as a EPSG ID. I found this ID (102003) with a little Googling. It uses
  the NAD83 datum.\n\n    ``` r\n    ggplot() +\n      geom_sf(data = states) +\n
  \     coord_sf(crs = st_crs(102003))\n    ```\n\n    ![](spatial-vis_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)\n"
