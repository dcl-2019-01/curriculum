desc: "\nSpatial packages\n----------------\n\nIn R, there are two main lineages of
  tools for dealing with spatial data: sp and sf.\n\n-   sp has been around for a
  while (the first release was in 2005), and it has a rich ecosystem of tools built
  on top of it. However, it uses a rather complex data structure, which can make it
  challenging to use.\n\n-   sf is newer (first released in October 2016!) so it doesn't
  have such a rich ecosystem. However, it's much easier to use and fits in very naturally
  with the tidyverse, and the ecosystem around it will grow rapidly.\n\nIn this class,
  we're going to use sf, so start by installing it:\n\n``` r\ninstall.packages(\"sf\")\n```\n\nLoading
  data\n------------\n\nTo read spatial data in R, use `read_sf()`. The following
  example reads an example dataset built into the sf package:\n\n``` r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sf)\n\n#
  The counties of North Carolina\nnc <- read_sf(system.file(\"shape/nc.shp\", package
  = \"sf\"))\n```\n\nHere we're loading from a **shapefile** which is the way spatial
  data is most commonly stored. Despite the name a shapefile isn't just one file,
  but is a collection of files that have the same name, but different extensions.
  Typically you'll have four files:\n\n-   `.shp` contains the geometry, and `.shx`
  contains an index into that geometry.\n\n-   `.dbf` contains metadata about each
  geometry (the other columns in the data frame).\n\n-   `.prf` contains the coordinate
  system and projection information. You'll learn more about that shortly.\n\n`read_sf()`
  can read in the majority of spatial file formats, so don't worry if your data isn't
  in a shapefile; the chances are `read_sf()` will still be able to read it.\n\nConverting
  data\n---------------\n\nIf you get a spatial object created by another package,
  us `st_as_sf()` to convert it to sf. For example, you can take data from the maps
  package (included in base R) and convert it to sf:\n\n``` r\nlibrary(maps)\n#> \n#>
  Attaching package: 'maps'\n#> The following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n#>
  \n#>     map\nnz_map <- map(\"nz\", plot = FALSE)\nnz_sf <- st_as_sf(nz_map)\n```\n\nData
  structure\n--------------\n\n`nc` is a data frame, and not a tibble, so when printing,
  it's a good idea to use `head()` so you only see the first few rows:\n\n``` r\nhead(nc)\n#>

  is an ordinary data frame, with one exception: the **geometry** column. This column
  contains **simple features**, a standard way of representing two dimesional geometries
  like points, lines, polygons, multilines, and multipolygons. Multilines and multipolygons
  are nededed to represent geographic phenomena like a river with multiple branches,
  or a state made up of multiple islands.\n\n``` r\nnc$geometry\n#> Geometry set for
  100 features \n#> geometry type:  MULTIPOLYGON\n#> dimension:      XY\n#> bbox:
  \          xmin: -84.32385 ymin: 33.88199 xmax: -75.45698 ymax: 36.58965\n#> epsg

  36.24098, -77.23461 3...\n```\n\nUse `plot()` to show the geometry. You'll learn
  how to use ggplot2 for more complex data visualisations in the next unit.\n\n```
  r\nplot(nc$geometry)\n```\n\n![](spatial-basics_files/figure-markdown_github/nc-plot-1.png)\n\nManipulating
  with dplyr\n-----------------------\n\nSince an sf object is just a data frame,
  you can manipulate it with dplyr. The following example gives you a taste:\n\n```
  r\nnz_sf %>%\n  mutate(area = as.numeric(st_area(geometry))) %>%\n  filter(area
  > 1e10)\n#> Simple feature collection with 2 features and 2 fields\n#> geometry
  type:  POLYGON\n#> dimension:      XY\n#> bbox:           xmin: 166.3961 ymin: -46.74155
  xmax: 178.5629 ymax: -34.39895\n#> epsg (SRID):    4326\n#> proj4string:    +proj=longlat
  +datum=WGS84 +no_defs\n#>              ID         area                       geometry\n#>
  1 North.Island  113469632351 POLYGON ((172.7433 -34.4421...\n#> 2 South.Island  150444467051
  POLYGON ((172.6391 -40.5135...\n```\n\n`st_area()` returns an object with units
  (i.e. *m*<sup>2</sup>), which is precise, but a little annoying to work with. I
  used `as.numeric()` to convert to a regular numeric vector.\n\nGeometry\n--------\n\nThe
  geometry column is a list-column. You'll learn more about list-columns later in
  the course, but in brief, they're the richest and most complex type of column because
  a list can contain any other data structure, including other lists.\n\nIt's worthwhile
  to pull out one piece so you can see what's going on under the hood:\n\n``` r\nstr(nc$geometry[[1]])\n#>
  List of 1\n#>  $ :List of 1\n#>   ..$ : num [1:27, 1:2] -81.5 -81.5 -81.6 -81.6
  -81.7 ...\n#>  - attr(*, \"class\")= chr [1:3] \"XY\" \"MULTIPOLYGON\" \"sfg\"\nplot(nc$geometry[[1]])\n```\n\n![](spatial-basics_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)\n\nNote
  the use of `[[` to extract a single element, here, the first polygon.\n\nThis is
  list of lists of matrices:\n\n-   The top-level list has one element for each \"landmass\"
  in the county. We can find a more interesting case:\n\n    ``` r\n    n <- nc$geometry
  %>% map_int(length)\n    table(n)\n    #> n\n    #>  1  2  3 \n    #> 94  4  2\n\n
  \   interesting <- nc$geometry[n == 3][[1]]\n    plot(interesting)\n    ```\n\n
  \   ![](spatial-basics_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)\n\n    ```
  r\n    str(interesting)\n    #> List of 3\n    #>  $ :List of 1\n    #>   ..$ :
  num [1:26, 1:2] -76 -76 -76 -76 -76.1 ...\n    #>  $ :List of 1\n    #>   ..$ :
  num [1:7, 1:2] -76 -76 -75.9 -75.9 -76 ...\n    #>  $ :List of 1\n    #>   ..$ :
  num [1:5, 1:2] -75.9 -75.9 -75.8 -75.8 -75.9 ...\n    #>  - attr(*, \"class\")=
  chr [1:3] \"XY\" \"MULTIPOLYGON\" \"sfg\"\n    ```\n\n    This is a county made
  up of three non-contiguous pieces.\n\n-   The second-level list is not used in this
  dataset, but is needed when you have a landmass that contains an lake. (Or a landmass
  that contains an lake which has an island which has a pond).\n\n-   Each row of
  the matrix gives the location of a point on the boundary of the polygon.\n\nCoordinate
  system\n-----------------\n\nTo correctly plot spatial data, you need know exactly
  what the numeric positions mean, i.e. what are they in reference to? This is called
  the **coordinate reference system** or CRS. Often spatial data is described in terms
  of latitude and longitude. You can check this with `st_is_longlat()`:\n\n``` r\nst_is_longlat(nc)\n#>
  [1] TRUE\n```\n\nYou might think that if you know the latitude and longitude of
  a point, you know exactly where it is on the Earth. However, things are not quite
  so simple, because latitude and longitude are based on the assumption that the Earth
  is a smooth ellipsoid, which is not true. Because different approximations work
  better in differently places, most countries have their own approximation: this
  is called the **geodetic datum**, or just **datum** for short.\n\nTake two minutes
  and watch this simple explanation of the datum: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKGlMp__jog>\n\nTo
  get the datum and other coordinate system metadata, use `st_crs()`:\n\n``` r\nst_crs(nc)\n#>
  Coordinate Reference System:\n#>   EPSG: 4267 \n#>   proj4string: \"+proj=longlat
  +datum=NAD27 +no_defs\"\n```\n\nHere the datum is \"NAD27\", the [North American
  Datum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Datum) of 1927 (NAD27)\n\nIn
  this class, you won't have to worry too much about the datum as sf and ggplot2 will
  take care of the details for you. But it's good to know why it exists and how to
  identify it if something goes wrong.\n"
