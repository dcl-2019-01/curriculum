title: Programming with dplyr
desc: |
  At some point during the quarter, you may have noticed that you were
  copy-and-pasting the same dplyr snippets again and again. You then might
  have remembered it's a bad idea to have more than three copies of the same
  code and tried to create function. Unfortunately it's likely that you failed
  because dplyr verbs work a little differently to most other R functions.
  In this unit, you'll learn exactly what makes dplyr verbs different,
  and a new set of techniques so that you can program with them.
