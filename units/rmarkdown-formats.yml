  We've only touched briefly on RMarkdown's capability to produce different
  forms of output. In this class you have used `github_document` which
  makes it very easy to publish your results on GitHub. There are three
  formats that you should know about:

  * [`html_document`](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/html_document_format.html):
    this produces a stand-alone HTML document that you can easily share over
    email.

  * [`revealjs::revealjs_presentation`](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/revealjs_presentation_format.html):
    this makes an HTML presentation which you can use when you need to present
    your data to a live audience.

  * [`flexdashboard::flex_dashboard`](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/):
    this makes dashboards which can be convenient way to lay out multiple plots
    and tables on a single screen.
