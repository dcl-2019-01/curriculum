  The two most common ways for data to be messy are to have:

  1. One variable spread across multiple columns.
  1. One observation scattered across multiple rows.

  To fix these problems you need `spread()` and `gather()` from the
  tidyr package.

  `spread()` and `gather()` also illustrate a new type of missingness.
  So far we've discussed explicit missing values (`NA`), but it's also
  possible for missing values to be simply absent from the data.

    (explicit vs implicit).
    We haven't covered the vocabulary of "tidy data" yet, but be aware that
    different ways of organisation the same data may make explicit missing
    values that were previously implicit in the data.
