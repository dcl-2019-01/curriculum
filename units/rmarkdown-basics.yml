title: R Markdown basics
theme: communicate

desc: |
  Experience the full data science workflow by creating an RMarkdown file that
  includes prose and code. __Knit__ the file to create output that intermingles
  your text and the results of the code. This is an authentic workflow: the only
  difference between this and what you'll use as a data scientist is that in
  this class you'll always show your code so we can give you feedback on both
  your results _and_ your process.
