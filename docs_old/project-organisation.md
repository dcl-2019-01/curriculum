# Project organisation <small class='workflow'>[workflow]</small>


Now that we're at week 3, it's worth reviewing how you're organising your
code. Good organisation is critical now and in the future, because it's
much easier to re-solve a problem you've seen before if you can easily
locate the code you used to solve it the last time.
