# Learning workflow <small class='workflow'>[workflow]</small>


You will get the most out of this class if you learn some tools and
techniques for exploratory reading, getting help, and recording
what you've learned.

## Readings

  * Reading. Strategies for effective reading, integrating information from multiple places, following links, accepting incompleteness. What is tacit knowledge, how to recognise when youâ€™re missing it, and what to do about it. [TODO]

  * Asking questions. How to effectively ask questions so that we can answer them effectively. How to title issues, what is reprex (morally), using reprex package, code formatting for readability etc... Using google. [TODO]

  * Note taking. How do you record what you've learned so you can reuse later (copy-and-paste from previous work as a skill). Using README's in github. [TODO]

  * [Common problems](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#common-problems) [r4ds-3.4]
