When you get stuck, first try and solve the problem yourself. A really
powerful tool to do this is to pretend you are asking help from someone
else. Start by clearly defining the problem, trying to find the smallest
snippet of code that illustrates the problem. This is called a minimal
reproducible example, or __reprex__ for short. Often creating the reprex
leads you to the solution because it forces you to carefully work through
each step. Even if it doesn't resolve the problem, you're now in a
better place to ask for help from another human.

To create reprexes we strongly recommend using the reprex package. It's not
available on CRAN yet, but you can install it from GitHub by running
this code:

```R
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jennybc/reprex")
```
