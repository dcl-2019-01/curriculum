# The grammar of graphics <small class='explore'>[explore]</small>
<small>(Builds on: [Visualisation basics (2)](vis-basics-2.md))</small>  
<small>(Leads to: [Perception](vis-perception.md), [Grouped summaries](vis-summaries.md), [ggplot2 themes](vis-themes.md))</small>

Now is a good time to learn a bit more about the underlying theory
of ggplot2. Read these two short chapters to familiarise yourself
with the theory and learn some useful vocabulary.
