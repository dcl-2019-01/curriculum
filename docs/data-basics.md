Learn what a data frame looks like when printed, and identify its variables
and their types. We're going to use the `mpg` and `flights` datasets
frequently, so you'll start by familiarising yourself with them.

NB: when we need to be specific about which package a dataset or function
comes from, we write it like `package_name::function_name`. `mpg`
and `flights` come from the ggplot2 and nycflights13 packages respectively,
so when we want to be explicit we'll write `ggplot2::mpg` and
`nycflights13::flights`.
