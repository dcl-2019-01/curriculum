It's helpful to know a little bit about how data structures are organised in R. In this reading, you'll learn about vectors, lists, and tibbles.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

Atomic vectors
--------------

The atomic vectors are the "atoms" of R, the simple building blocks upon which all else is built. There are four types of atomic vector that are important for data analysis:

-   **integer** vectors `<int>` contain integers.
-   **double** vectors `<dbl>` contain real numbers.
-   **character** vector `<chr>` contain strings made with `""`.
-   **logical** vectors `<lgl>` contain `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

Integer atomic vectors only contain integers, double atomic vectors only contain doubles, and so on.

All vectors can also contain the missing value `NA`. You'll learn more about missing values later on. Collectively integer and double vectors are known as **numeric** vectors. The difference is rarely important in R.

You create atomic vectors by hand with the `c()` function:

``` r
logical <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)

# The difference between the real number 1 and the integer 1 is not 
# usually important, but it sometimes comes up. R uses the suffix 
# "L" to indicate that a number is an integer.
integer <- c(1L, 2L, 3L)

double <- c(1.5, 2.8, pi)

character <- c("this", "is", "a character", "vector")
```

### Subsetting

Use `[[` extract a single value out of a vector:

``` r
x <- c(5.1, 4.2, 5.3, 1.4)
x[[2]]
#> [1] 4.2
```

Use `[` to extract multiple values:

``` r
# Keep selected locations
x[c(1, 3)]
#> [1] 5.1 5.3

# Drop selected locations
x[-1]
#> [1] 4.2 5.3 1.4

# Select locations where the condition is true
x[x > 5]
#> [1] 5.1 5.3
```

The names of these functions are `[` and `[[` but are used like `x[y]` (pronounced "x square-bracket y") and `x[[y]]` (pronounced "x double-square-bracket y"). You can get help on them with `` ?`[` `` and `` ?`[[` ``.

### Augmented vectors

Augmented vectors are atomic vectors with additional metadata. There are four important augmented vectors:

-   **factors** `<fct>`, which are used to represent categorical variables can take one of a fixed and known set of possible values (called the levels).

-   **ordered factors** `<ord>`, which are like factors but where the levels have an intrinsic ordering (i.e. it's reasonable to say that one level is "less than" or "greater than" another variable).

-   **dates** `<dt>`, record a date.

-   **date-times** `<dttm>`, which are also known as POSIXct, record a date and a time.

For now, you just need to recognize these when you encounter them. You'll learn how to create each type of augmented vector later in the course.

Lists
-----

Unlike atomic vectors, which can only contain a single type, lists can contain any collection of R objects. The following reading will introduce you to lists.

Tibbles
-------

You can think of tibbles as lists of vectors, where every vector has the same length. There are two ways to create tibbles by hand:

1.  From individual vectors, each representing a column:

    ``` r
    my_tibble <- tibble(
      x = c(1, 9, 5),
      y = c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE),
      z = c("apple", "pear", "banana")
    )
    my_tibble
    #> # A tibble: 3 x 3
    #>       x y     z     
    #>   <dbl> <lgl> <chr> 
    #> 1     1 TRUE  apple 
    #> 2     9 FALSE pear  
    #> 3     5 FALSE banana
    ```

2.  From individual values, organised in rows:

    ``` r
    my_tibble <- tribble(
      ~x, ~y,    ~z,
      1,  TRUE,  "apple",
      9,  FALSE, "pear",
      5,  FALSE, "banana"
    )
    my_tibble
    #> # A tibble: 3 x 3
    #>       x y     z     
    #>   <dbl> <lgl> <chr> 
    #> 1     1 TRUE  apple 
    #> 2     9 FALSE pear  
    #> 3     5 FALSE banana
    ```

Typically it will be obvious whether you need to use `tibble()` or `tribble()`. One representation will either be much shorter or much clearer than the other.

### Dimensions

When you print a tibble it tell you its column names and the overall dimensions:

``` r
diamonds
#> # A tibble: 53,940 x 10
#>    carat cut       color clarity depth table price     x     y     z
#>    <dbl> <ord>     <ord> <ord>   <dbl> <dbl> <int> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
#>  1 0.23  Ideal     E     SI2      61.5    55   326  3.95  3.98  2.43
#>  2 0.21  Premium   E     SI1      59.8    61   326  3.89  3.84  2.31
#>  3 0.23  Good      E     VS1      56.9    65   327  4.05  4.07  2.31
#>  4 0.290 Premium   I     VS2      62.4    58   334  4.2   4.23  2.63
#>  5 0.31  Good      J     SI2      63.3    58   335  4.34  4.35  2.75
#>  6 0.24  Very Good J     VVS2     62.8    57   336  3.94  3.96  2.48
#>  7 0.24  Very Good I     VVS1     62.3    57   336  3.95  3.98  2.47
#>  8 0.26  Very Good H     SI1      61.9    55   337  4.07  4.11  2.53
#>  9 0.22  Fair      E     VS2      65.1    61   337  3.87  3.78  2.49
#> 10 0.23  Very Good H     VS1      59.4    61   338  4     4.05  2.39
#> # â€¦ with 53,930 more rows
```

If you want to get access dimensions directly, you have three options:

``` r
dim(diamonds)
#> [1] 53940    10
nrow(diamonds)
#> [1] 53940
ncol(diamonds)
#> [1] 10
```

To get the variable names, use `names()`:

``` r
names(diamonds)
#>  [1] "carat"   "cut"     "color"   "clarity" "depth"   "table"   "price"  
#>  [8] "x"       "y"       "z"
```

There isn't currently a convenient way to get the variable types, but you can use `purrr::map_chr()` to apply `type_sum()` (short for type summary) to each variable.

``` r
type_sum(diamonds)
#> [1] "tibble"
map_chr(diamonds, type_sum)
#>   carat     cut   color clarity   depth   table   price       x       y 
#>   "dbl"   "ord"   "ord"   "ord"   "dbl"   "dbl"   "int"   "dbl"   "dbl" 
#>       z 
#>   "dbl"
```

### Variables

You can extract a variable out of a tibble by using `[[` or `$`:

``` r
mtcars[["mpg"]]
#>  [1] 21.0 21.0 22.8 21.4 18.7 18.1 14.3 24.4 22.8 19.2 17.8 16.4 17.3 15.2
#> [15] 10.4 10.4 14.7 32.4 30.4 33.9 21.5 15.5 15.2 13.3 19.2 27.3 26.0 30.4
#> [29] 15.8 19.7 15.0 21.4
mtcars$mpg
#>  [1] 21.0 21.0 22.8 21.4 18.7 18.1 14.3 24.4 22.8 19.2 17.8 16.4 17.3 15.2
#> [15] 10.4 10.4 14.7 32.4 30.4 33.9 21.5 15.5 15.2 13.3 19.2 27.3 26.0 30.4
#> [29] 15.8 19.7 15.0 21.4
```

For this reason, when we want to be precise about which tibble a variable comes from, we use the syntax `dataset$variablename`.

The dplyr equivalent, which can more easily be used in a pipe, is `pull()`:

``` r
mtcars %>% pull(mpg)
#>  [1] 21.0 21.0 22.8 21.4 18.7 18.1 14.3 24.4 22.8 19.2 17.8 16.4 17.3 15.2
#> [15] 10.4 10.4 14.7 32.4 30.4 33.9 21.5 15.5 15.2 13.3 19.2 27.3 26.0 30.4
#> [29] 15.8 19.7 15.0 21.4
```
