It is extremely rare to only require a single table of data for an analysis.
Far more often you will need to combine together multiple sources of
information. Interconnected datasets are often called __relational__ because
you need to care about the relationships between the datasets.

Here you'll first learn about the __keys__ that define the relationship.
You'll then learn about __mutating__ joins, so called because their primary
impact is to add new columns, like a `mutate()`. Itâ€™s also useful to learn
about the __filtering__ joins, `semi_join()` and `anti_join()`, which work
primarily like a `filter()`, restricting the rows.
