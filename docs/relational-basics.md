It is extremely rare to only require a single table of data for an analysis.
Far more often you will need to combine together multiple sources of
information. Interconnected datasets is often called __relational__ because
you need to care about the relationships between the datasets.

Here you'll learn about the __keys__ which define the relationship, and
the __mutating joins__, the first set of tools for working with related
dataset.
