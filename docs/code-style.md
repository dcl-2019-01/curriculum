Code style is simultaneously incredibly important and utterly trivial.
It'slikepunctuation: sureyoucanmakedowithoutit, but proper punctuation
can sure make things easier to read!

Install styler with `install.packages("styler")` and make sure you can
locate the RStudio addin command for restyling selected code. This will
make it very easy to apply the tidyverse style guide automatically.

## Readings

  * [Style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org).
    Read Chapters 1-4. The specific style you follow is not as important as
    picking a consistent style and sticking to it. When you're working with
    others, it's a really good idea to share a common style so that everyone
    can easily read and write the code. In this class, we'll use the tidyverse
    style guide.
