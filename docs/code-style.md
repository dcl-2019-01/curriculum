Code style is simultaneously incredibly important and utterly trivial.
It'slikepunctuation: sureyoucanmakedowithoutit, but proper punctuation
can sure make things easier to read!

The specific style you follow is not as important as picking a consistent
style and sticking to it. When you're working with others, it's a really
good idea to share a common style so that everyone can easily read and
write the code. These readings will introduce you to a common style.

Install styler with `install.packages("styler")` and make sure you can
locate the RStudio addin command for restyling selected code. This will
make it very easy to apply the tidyverse style guide automatically.
