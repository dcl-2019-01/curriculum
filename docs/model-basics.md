This course approaches modelling a little differently to most statistics
courses. We're not going to rigorously covering the mathematical foundation
of models. Instead, you'll get some intution about what a model does,
and then learn some computation tools for exploring fitted models.

In this unit, you'll build up your intuition for what a model does, and what
it tells you about a dataset.
