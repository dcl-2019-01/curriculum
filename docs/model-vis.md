It is possible to understand some models (particularly popular statistical
models) by learning how to interpret their coefficients. We're not going
to take that approach here for two reasons:

* It requires many months of study to interpret the coefficients of even
  fairly simple model classes like logistic regression or survival analysis.

* Modern model classes (like random forests or SVMs) may have 100s or
  1000s (or more!) coefficients.

Instead, we'll understand a model by looking at it's predictions. This
doesn't cover every possible type of model (because not every model makes
predictions) but it does cover a very wide class, including most models in
statistics and machine learning.
