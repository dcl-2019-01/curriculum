# Programming with dplyr <small class='program'>[program]</small>
<small>(Builds on: [Scoped verbs](manip-scoped.md))</small>

At some point during the quarter, you may have noticed that you were
copy-and-pasting the same dplyr snippets again and again. You then might
have remembered it's a bad idea to have more than three copies of the same
code and tried to create function. Unfortunately it's likely that you failed
because dplyr verbs work a little differently to most other R functions.
In this unit, you'll learn exactly what makes dplyr verbs different,
and a new set of techniques so that you can program with them.
