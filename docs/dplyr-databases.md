<small>(Builds on: [Essentials of relational data](relational-basics.md))</small>

So far you've used dplyr with in-memory dataframes. But one of the coolest

you can use the same code to work with data stored in different places.
In this unit, you'll learn how to use dplyr with data that lives in a
database.
