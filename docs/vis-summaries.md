Summary functions take a vector of data and return a single number; you
use them in conjunction with `dplyr::summarise()`. The ggplot2 equivalent
are the summary geoms, which split the data into pieces, apply some summary
and visualise the results.

Summaries are useful when you have a lot of data (and plotting it all leads
to overplotting), or when the data is noisy (and you need to make small
but consistent patterns more clear).

    some aggregation before visualising the data.
